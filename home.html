                        Is NBA TopShot an <span class="highlight">NFT</span>?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>NFTs</strong> (non-fungible tokens) are certificates of <strong>ownership</strong> of <strong>digital</strong> objects - from works of art to video game items. Recently, NFTs have moved from art and fashion to other fields, in this case, the world of <strong>sports</strong>.<br>
                        <br>
                        <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/">NBA TopShot</a> is a new way to experience basketball as a fan. TopShot is a <strong>blockchain-based platform</strong> built on <a href="https://flow.com/">Flow</a>. <br>
                        <br>
                        The platform <strong>creates</strong> and <strong>sells</strong> a type of NFT. NFTs use blockchain technology to create <strong>unique</strong>, <strong>digital assets</strong> - usually <strong>collectibles</strong> - that can be verified as <strong>genuine</strong> and <strong>one-of-a-kind</strong>.<br>
                        <br>
                        It allows basketball fans to <strong>buy</strong>, <strong>sell</strong>, and <strong>trade</strong> <strong>officially-licensed digitally captured highlights</strong> as <strong>NFTs</strong> called <strong>Moments</strong>. By collecting Moments, fans can get rewarded along with having the ultimate fan bragging rights. These licensed digital collectables are similar to virtual basketball cards.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        What is a <span class="highlight">Moment</span>?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Moments are <strong>digitally captured highlights</strong> from the past and present. Moments can be aquired through <strong>pack drops</strong>, <strong>challenges</strong>, and the <strong>Marketplace</strong>.<br>
                        <br>
                        Think of each one as a digital version of a traditional sports card, only with a few advantages. First, there’s essentially no chance of buying a counterfeit moment: each one is “minted” with a unique serial number on the Flow blockchain, and you can access a complete transaction history for your specific version.

                        <p>
                            The Marketplace is where NBA TopShot Moments are bought and sold. It is a <strong>digital platform</strong> for NBA fans to buy and trade video clips (moments) of games. The moments are sold as <strong>NFTs</strong> and are approved by the <strong>NBA</strong>. <br>
                            <br>
                            Some of them have been purchased and traded for tens, and hundreds of thousands of dollars. A mmoment of Lebron James offering a dunk in memory of Kobe Byrant was sold for nearly $387,000.<br>
                            <br>
                            While these clips can be viewed online, what buyers are interested in is mostly <strong>ownership</strong>. Anyone can view the video online, but only the purchaser of the NFT can boast ownership.
